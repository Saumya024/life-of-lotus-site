    <h1>Advaita Vedanta Self-Inquiry</h1>
    <div class="modality-category-tag">Meditation, Awareness & Liberation Traditions</div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You ask yourself the question 'Who am I?' and trace thoughts back to their source</li>
        <li>Rather than answering with concepts, you look directly at what is aware</li>
        <li>The practice reveals that what you truly are is not any thought, feeling, or body sensation</li>
        <li>Traditional teaching often involves dialogue with a teacher who points to your true nature</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>What People Typically Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognition that they are not their thoughts or emotions</li>
        <li>A sense of spacious awareness underlying all experience</li>
        <li>Relief from the constant mental commentary about themselves</li>
        <li>Moments where the sense of being a separate self dissolves</li>
        <li>Greater peace that doesn't depend on circumstances</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People who have meditated and want to go deeper</li>
        <li>Those exhausted by trying to fix or improve themselves</li>
        <li>Anyone drawn to questions about the nature of consciousness</li>
        <li>People who sense there's something deeper than their personality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is this a philosophy or a practice?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Both. Advaita Vedanta is a philosophical framework, but self-inquiry is the practical application—direct investigation rather than just conceptual understanding.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Do I need to study Hindu scriptures?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Not necessarily. While the tradition has rich texts, the core practice is simply looking at what is aware right now. Some teachers emphasize direct inquiry over study.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What if I don't get an answer when I ask 'Who am I?'</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">That's the point. The question isn't meant to be answered conceptually—it's meant to turn attention back to its source and reveal what was always already there.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is this about having special experiences?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">No. It's about recognizing what is always present, not achieving special states. The ordinary awareness reading these words right now is what the inquiry points to.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How is this different from therapy or self-improvement?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Self-improvement assumes there's a self that needs fixing. Self-inquiry questions the nature of that self entirely. It's not about becoming a better person but seeing what you actually are.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Can I practice this on my own?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Yes, though working with a qualified teacher can be helpful. The inquiry itself is simple, but the mind can create subtle traps that a teacher can help navigate.</div>
