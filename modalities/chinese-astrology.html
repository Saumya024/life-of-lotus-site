      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your birth year, month, day, and hour are converted into four 'pillars' of heavenly stems and earthly branches</li>
        <li>This creates a chart showing the balance of five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) in your makeup</li>
        <li>A practitioner analyzes which elements you have in abundance and which are lacking</li>
        <li>Life cycles and annual luck pillars are examined to understand timing and phases</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>What People Typically Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Insight into their fundamental nature and temperament</li>
        <li>Understanding of which environments and activities support their energy</li>
        <li>Clarity on relationships and compatibility with others</li>
        <li>Better timing for major decisions like marriage, business, or career moves</li>
        <li>Recognition of 10-year luck cycles and what each brings</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What's the difference between my Chinese zodiac animal and my full chart?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Your animal sign is just one piece. A complete chart includes four pillars (year, month, day, hour), each with its own animal and element. This creates a much more nuanced picture.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Why do Chinese astrology readings focus so much on elements?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Element balance is considered fundamental to health, success, and wellbeing. Understanding your elemental makeup helps identify what you need more of in your environment and activities.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What are luck pillars?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">These are 10-year periods that influence the overall theme and opportunities of that phase. Knowing when your luck pillars shift helps with long-term planning.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Can Chinese astrology help with business decisions?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">It's extensively used for timing business launches, hiring, and partnerships. Many business owners in Asia consult practitioners before major moves.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is the Chinese zodiac year accurate if I was born in January or February?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">The Chinese New Year falls between late January and mid-February. If you were born before the new year, you belong to the previous year's animal sign.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How does this connect to Feng Shui?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">They're part of the same system. Your Chinese astrology chart can inform which Feng Shui adjustments would benefit you most based on your personal element needs.</div>
