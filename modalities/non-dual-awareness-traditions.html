    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>These approaches point directly to the awareness that is reading these words right now</li>
        <li>Rather than practicing to achieve something, you recognize what is already present</li>
        <li>Teachings often use dialogue, questions, or pointers to shift attention from content to awareness itself</li>
        <li>The 'practice' is more about stopping and noticing than doing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>What People Typically Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Moments where the sense of being a separate observer dissolves</li>
        <li>Recognition that awareness has no edges or boundaries</li>
        <li>Relief from the burden of maintaining a self-image</li>
        <li>Sense that peace was always here, just overlooked</li>
        <li>Ordinary life becoming more vivid and less problematic</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People who have explored other spiritual paths and sense something more direct is possible</li>
        <li>Those tired of seeking and wanting to recognize what's already here</li>
        <li>Anyone curious about the nature of consciousness itself</li>
        <li>People drawn to teachers like Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta, or contemporary non-dual teachers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What does 'non-dual' mean?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">It points to the recognition that subject and object, self and world, aren't actually separate. The appearance of separation is seen through, revealing seamless wholeness.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is this a religion?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Non-dual teachings appear across many traditions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Christian mysticism. It's a recognition about the nature of experience, not a belief system to adopt.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">If there's nothing to do, why do people attend retreats or see teachers?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">The mind has deeply ingrained patterns of seeking. Spending time with a teacher who has seen through these patterns can help clarify what was always obvious.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Does this mean I shouldn't care about my life?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Not at all. Life continues—you still eat, work, have relationships. What changes is the suffering created by believing you're separate from life.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How do I know if I've 'gotten it'?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">The question assumes 'getting it' is a new experience to acquire. It's more like noticing what was never absent. If you're asking from genuine curiosity rather than seeking validation, you're already looking in the right direction.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is this the same as meditation?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Some teachers say yes, some say no. Non-dual recognition can happen during meditation, but it's not dependent on it. It's about what you already are, not what you achieve through practice.</div>
