    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A practitioner studies your birth chart—a snapshot of where the planets were at the exact moment you were born</li>
        <li>Your chart is divided into houses representing different life areas like career, relationships, and health</li>
        <li>Planetary periods and current transits are analyzed to understand what themes are active in your life right now</li>
        <li>Specific questions can be explored using focused techniques suited to the area of concern</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>What People Typically Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarity on why certain patterns keep repeating despite efforts to change</li>
        <li>Better understanding of timing—when to push forward, when to pause</li>
        <li>Recognition of natural strengths that weren't being fully used</li>
        <li>Relief from confusion about phases that felt unusually difficult</li>
        <li>A sense of validation that struggles had a context, not just bad luck</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">
      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>People facing decisions where timing genuinely matters</li>
        <li>Those noticing the same struggles showing up across different life areas</li>
        <li>Anyone wanting perspective on why certain periods feel harder than others</li>
        <li>People seeking clarity that goes beyond surface-level advice</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What information do I need for a Vedic astrology reading?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">You'll need your exact birth date, time, and location. The birth time is especially important—even a few minutes can shift the chart significantly. If you don't have your exact time, some practitioners can work with approximate times or use other techniques.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How is Vedic astrology different from the horoscopes I see online?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Those horoscopes are based only on your Sun sign. Vedic astrology uses your complete birth chart with all planets, houses, and their interactions. It's far more personalized and detailed than general predictions.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Can Vedic astrology predict the future?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">It identifies patterns and timing cycles, showing when certain themes are likely to intensify or ease. It's less about fixed predictions and more about understanding the terrain ahead so you can navigate it better.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How often should I consult a Vedic astrologer?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Most people find value in a reading during major life transitions or once every year or two. You don't need frequent consultations unless you're navigating a particularly complex period.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is Vedic astrology connected to any religion?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">While it originated in ancient India, Vedic astrology is a practical system of timing and pattern recognition. People of all backgrounds and beliefs use it without religious conflict.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What's the difference between Vedic and Western astrology?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Vedic astrology uses the sidereal zodiac (based on actual star positions), while Western astrology uses the tropical zodiac. They also differ in techniques—Vedic astrology places strong emphasis on planetary periods called dashas.</div>
