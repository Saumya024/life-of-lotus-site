It's not the same as Dissociative Identity Disorder, which is a clinical condition.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Do I need to believe in this parts model for it to work?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Not necessarily. Many people find it helpful as a practical framework for understanding their inner experience, regardless of whether they take it literally.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">How long does IFS therapy typically take?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">It varies. Some people see shifts in a few sessions; deeper work may take months or longer. The pace depends on your goals and what you're working with.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Can I practice IFS on my own?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Some people learn to work with parts independently, but starting with a trained IFS therapist is recommended to learn the model properly.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Is IFS evidence-based?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Research on IFS is growing. It's been studied for conditions like depression, trauma, and anxiety, with promising results. More research is ongoing.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">What if I can't access my Self?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">This is common, especially early on. A trained IFS therapist helps you identify what's blocking Self-access and works with those protective parts first.</div></div></div><div class="modality-ctas"><a href="../reading-viewing.html?modality=internal-family-systems" class="modality-cta-primary">Explore Learning Resources</a><a href="../practitioner-listings.html?modality=internal-family-systems" class="modality-cta-secondary">Find Practitioners</a></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-content"><div class="footer-logo"><img src="../assets/images/Gardenia Fashion Brand Art Design Logo (5).png" alt="Life of Lotus" /></div><nav class="footer-nav"><a href="../index.html">Home</a><a href="../about.html">About</a><a href="../index.html#pricing">Pricing</a>
