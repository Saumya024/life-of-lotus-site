It focuses on how early experiences shaped your sense of self, not just symptoms.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Do I need to remember specific childhood events?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">No. NARM works with present-moment patterns and how they show up in your body and relationships. You don't need detailed memories of the past.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">How long does NARM therapy typically take?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">It varies based on the depth of developmental trauma. Some people see shifts in months; deeper work may take longer. The process is often more efficient than traditional talk therapy for these issues.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Is NARM only for people with severe trauma?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">No. It helps anyone whose early relational experiences created patterns that limit their current life, whether or not they identify as "traumatized."</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">What training do NARM therapists have?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">NARM therapists complete specialized training through the NARM Training Institute. Look for practitioners certified in NARM.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Can NARM be combined with other therapies?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Yes, though it's important to coordinate with other providers. NARM can complement other body-based or relational therapies when done thoughtfully.</div></div></div><div class="modality-ctas">
