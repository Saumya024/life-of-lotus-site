      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You spend several days to weeks in a structured environment without speaking</li>
        <li>Days include scheduled meditation periods, meals, and rest—all in silence</li>
        <li>The absence of conversation allows deeper encounter with your own mind</li>
        <li>Teachers or guides may offer instructions and individual meetings</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="modality-section">

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What if I've never meditated before?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Some retreats are specifically for beginners. Others expect prior experience. Check the requirements—many intro retreats welcome newcomers.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How long should my first retreat be?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Weekend retreats (2-3 days) are a gentle introduction. Traditional Vipassana courses are 10 days. Start with what feels manageable yet meaningful.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What if I get uncomfortable or want to leave?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Good retreat centers support participants. You can usually speak with a teacher if needed. That said, some discomfort is normal and often where the deepest learning happens.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is it boring to be silent for days?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Initially, yes—boredom often arises. But as the mind settles, boredom transforms. Many people discover richness in silence they didn't know was possible.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">What should I bring to a retreat?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Centers provide guidance. Generally: comfortable meditation clothes, personal items, and an open mind. Leave electronics behind or in a sealed bag.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Will I have breakthroughs or insights?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Some people do; some don't. The value isn't in dramatic experiences but in the ongoing settling and clarity that develops, often more noticeable after you return home.</div>
