This isn't about technique or looking good. It's about authentic movement as a path to healing and self-expression.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Will I have to dance in front of people?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Group settings involve shared movement, but it's not performance. Individual sessions are private. The focus is on your experience, not being watched.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">How can dancing help psychological issues?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">The body holds emotions and memories. Moving them literally—through the body—can access and transform what talking about can't reach.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">Is this appropriate for trauma?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Yes, with a trained therapist. Movement can help process trauma stored in the body in ways that feel empowering rather than re-traumatizing.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">What happens in a typical session?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">Varies by therapist and client. Might include warm-up, structured or free movement, reflection. The therapist attunes to what you need.</div></div><div class="modality-faq-item"><div class="modality-faq-question">How is this different from just dancing for fun?</div><div class="modality-faq-answer">The therapeutic relationship and trained guidance create a container for deeper work. Random dancing can be beneficial but therapy provides structure for healing.</div></div></div><div class="modality-ctas">
