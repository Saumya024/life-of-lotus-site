      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How is esoteric astrology different from regular astrology?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Traditional astrology focuses on personality traits and life events. Esoteric astrology looks at why your soul chose these particular circumstances and what you're meant to evolve through.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Do I need to believe in reincarnation?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">While esoteric astrology emerged from teachings that include reincarnation, you can find value in its perspectives without holding specific beliefs. Focus on what resonates and helps you grow.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Why is the rising sign so important in esoteric astrology?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">The rising sign is seen as the soul's intention for this lifetime—what you're here to develop and express. It's considered more significant than the Sun sign for understanding purpose.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Can esoteric astrology give practical guidance?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">Yes, but through a different lens. Rather than telling you what will happen, it helps you understand why certain themes matter and how to approach them as growth opportunities.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">Is this connected to any particular spiritual tradition?</div>
        <div class="modality-faq-answer">It emerged primarily through Theosophical teachings but has evolved independently. People from various spiritual paths find value in its framework.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="modality-faq-item">
        <div class="modality-faq-question">How do I find an esoteric astrologer?</div>
