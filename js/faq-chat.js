    category: "life-situation"
  },
  {
    question: "What is Vedic astrology?",
    answer: "Vedic astrology (Jyotish) is an ancient Indian system that uses your birth chart — calculated from your exact date, time, and place of birth — to reveal life patterns, timing cycles, and karmic themes. Unlike Western astrology, it uses the sidereal zodiac based on fixed star positions.<br><br>The system maps life into planetary periods (dashas) that determine which themes are active at any given time. This makes Vedic astrology particularly strong in timing and prediction — it's used for understanding recurring patterns, making better-timed decisions, and navigating transitions.",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a dasha in Vedic astrology?",
    answer: "A dasha is a planetary period that determines which planet governs a specific phase of your life. The Vimshottari Dasha system divides life into major periods of 6 to 20 years each, with sub-periods within them.<br><br>Each dasha activates themes associated with its ruling planet — a Jupiter dasha may bring expansion and opportunity, while a Saturn dasha may emphasize discipline and restructuring. Understanding your active dasha explains why certain themes dominate your current experience and when significant shifts are likely.",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "How is Vedic astrology different from Western astrology?",
    answer: "Vedic astrology uses the sidereal zodiac (fixed star positions) while Western astrology uses the tropical zodiac (seasons), meaning your Vedic sun sign is often different from your Western one.<br><br>Vedic astrology examines long-term karmic patterns and life timing through planetary periods (dashas), while Western astrology focuses more on psychological traits and current transits. The deeper difference is philosophical: Western astrology asks \"What is happening now?\" while Vedic astrology asks \"Why does this keep happening?\"",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "Is Vedic astrology compatible with my religion?",
    answer: "Yes. Vedic astrology emerged from Hindu philosophical traditions but functions as a technical system, not a religious practice. You don't need to adopt Hindu beliefs, worship deities, or change your worldview.<br><br>Many clients practice Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or hold secular perspectives. The consultation focuses on observable patterns in your life, not spiritual conversion. The core work — understanding patterns and making conscious choices — stands independent of any belief system.",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "Are Vedic astrology remedies religious?",
    answer: "No, Vedic astrology remedies are not inherently religious. While some (like mantras) have origins in spiritual traditions, they function as practical tools for awareness, discipline, and alignment.<br><br>Remedies may include:<ul><li>Mantras (sound-based practices)</li><li>Gemstones (for specific planetary influences)</li><li>Charitable acts (balance and giving back)</li><li>Timing adjustments (knowing when to act or wait)</li><li>Behavioral modifications (conscious changes in approach)</li></ul>These are suggested as practical supports, not religious requirements.",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "How many Vedic astrology sessions do I need?",
    answer: "There is no fixed number of sessions required. Many people find one session sufficient for immediate clarity on active patterns, timing, and responses.<br><br>Others return periodically when:<ul><li>Major transitions occur (career changes, relocations, relationship decisions)</li><li>New patterns activate in their chart</li><li>They need to understand how longer cycles are unfolding</li></ul>Follow-up timing is discussed at the end of each session. The goal is clarity that supports better decisions, not dependency.",
    category: "understanding"
  },
  {
    question: "What can I expect after my first session?",
    answer: "After your first consultation, you'll have a clearer understanding of the patterns active in your life, the timing cycles you're navigating, and how to respond more consciously. Many people experience immediate relief from confusion, as patterns they've sensed but couldn't name become visible.<br><br>You'll receive specific insights about current planetary periods, themes likely to surface, and when significant shifts may occur. Follow-up timing is discussed based on your chart's cycles.",
    category: "practical"
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need before booking?",
    answer: "You need three things to book a Vedic astrology consultation: your exact date of birth, precise time of birth, and place of birth (city and state/country). Birth time accuracy is crucial — even a 10-15 minute difference can alter chart calculations.<br><br>Also consider what questions or life areas you want to explore. Having 2-3 primary concerns helps tailor the session. No prior knowledge of astrology is needed.",
    category: "practical"
  },
  {
    question: "What if my birth time is unknown?",
    answer: "If your birth time is completely unknown, some techniques become unavailable.<br><br>It's better to be honest about uncertainty than to guess.",
    category: "practical"
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I consult a Vedic astrologer?",
    answer: "There is no fixed frequency. Most people consult during major transitions — career changes, relocations, relationship decisions, health crises. Others return periodically (annually or every few years) to understand longer cycles.<br><br>Follow-up timing is discussed at the end of each session based on your chart and life context.",
