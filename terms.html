      <p>All sessions are conducted with the understanding that the client retains full responsibility for their decisions and actions.</p>

      <h2>2. No Guarantees</h2>
      
      <p>While astrology can offer meaningful insight, no guarantees are made regarding outcomes, results, or future events.</p>
