        <p class="insight-subtitle">See through illusion. Ground your ambition. Find what's real.</p>
      </header>

      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">You want something, intensely. You pursue it, finally get it, and discover it's not what you thought. So you want something else, chase that, achieve it, and feel the same emptiness. An endless loop of desire and disappointment. You know something's off, but you can't stop wanting.</p>
        <p>This is Rahu. The shadow planet of desire, illusion, and obsession. Rahu creates the hunger that worldly achievement cannot fill. It makes you chase mirages, convinced they're oases. It amplifies ambition and clouds judgment in equal measure.</p>
        <p>But here's Rahu's secret: it's not trying to punish you. It's trying to teach you what's real versus what's illusion. The cure for Rahu isn't suppressing desire; it's learning to desire what actually satisfies. Rahu mastery is discernment.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Understanding Rahu -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Understanding Rahu: The Misunderstood Shadow</h2>
        <p>Rahu is the North Node of the Moon, a mathematical point where the Moon's orbit crosses the Sun's path. It has no physical body, only influence. This is significant:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Rahu represents unfulfilled desire from past lives</strong>, the things you crave but haven't earned through karma</li>
          <li><strong>Rahu amplifies whatever it touches</strong>, making it larger than life, distorted, obsessive</li>
          <li><strong>Rahu creates illusion</strong>, making you see things not as they are but as you want them to be</li>
          <li><strong>Rahu drives worldly ambition</strong>, especially toward material success, status, and unconventional paths</li>
          <li><strong>Rahu breaks boundaries</strong>, for better (innovation) or worse (transgression)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rahu isn't inherently malefic. It drives evolution. Problems arise when Rahu's energy is unconscious, manifesting as obsession, addiction, or chasing what never satisfies.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Signs of Rahu Issues -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Signs Your Rahu May Need Attention</h2>
        <p>Rahu creates distinctive patterns. You might benefit from Rahu remedies if you experience:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Obsessive thoughts</strong> — can't stop thinking about something, compulsive desire loops</li>
          <li><strong>Confusion and fog</strong> — unclear thinking, difficulty distinguishing what's real</li>
          <li><strong>Addiction patterns</strong> — substance abuse, behavioral addictions, compulsive consumption</li>
          <li><strong>Fear and paranoia</strong> — unnamed fears, phobias, feeling like something's always wrong</li>
          <li><strong>Sudden disruptions</strong> — unexpected upheavals, being cheated, backstabbed, or blindsided</li>
          <li><strong>Chasing illusions</strong> — achieving goals that don't satisfy, constantly moving goalposts</li>
          <li><strong>Identity confusion</strong> — not knowing who you really are, wearing masks</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign matters entanglements</strong> — immigration issues, foreign business complications</li>
          <li><strong>Skin problems</strong> — particularly mysterious or hard-to-diagnose conditions</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Rahu Mahadasha: The 18-Year Test</h2>
        <p>Rahu's major period (Mahadasha) lasts 18 years, the longest of any planet. It brings intense worldly experience.</p>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>What Rahu Mahadasha Brings</h4>

            <li><strong>Avoid all intoxicants.</strong> Rahu amplifies addictive tendencies. Complete sobriety is essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Meditate daily.</strong> Grounding practices counter Rahu's tendency to unground you.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't chase illusions.</strong> If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Durga worship.</strong> Durga controls Rahu. Make this a consistent practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid shortcuts.</strong> Rahu tempts with easy paths that lead to hard landings.</li>

      <!-- Rahu in Each House -->
      <section class="insight-section">

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Rahu Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Ground Yourself Daily (Essential)</h4>
          <p>Rahu ungrounds you, pulling you into fantasy, obsession, and unreality. Counter this with grounding practices: meditation, walking barefoot on earth, breathwork, or any practice that brings you into your body and the present moment. This isn't optional, it's the foundation of all Rahu work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Declutter Your Environment</h4>
          <p>Rahu thrives in confusion and clutter. Keep your space clean and organized. Clear hidden corners, storage areas, and anything that creates chaos. External order supports internal clarity. Rahu fog lifts when the environment is clear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Absolute Sobriety</h4>
          <p>No alcohol. No drugs. No intoxicants of any kind. This is the most important Rahu remedy and the least negotiable. Rahu amplifies addictive tendencies. What might be moderate use for others becomes slavery for those with strong Rahu. Complete sobriety, period.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>South-West Direction</h4>
          <p>The South-West is associated with Rahu. Keep hidden corners in this direction clean. Don't store junk, broken items, or chaotic things there. Some traditions place Rahu remedies or images in this direction.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Special Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Burn Camphor Regularly</h4>
          <p>Burning camphor purifies Rahu energy. The act of burning represents destroying illusions. Light camphor regularly, especially at dawn and dusk when Rahu's energy is strongest. Sit with it for a moment, letting the flame symbolize clarity burning through fog.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Meditate During Rahu Kaal</h4>
          <p>Rahu Kaal is a specific period each day when Rahu's energy is strongest. Instead of avoiding activity during this time, use it for meditation. This converts Rahu's intensity into spiritual fuel. Check local Rahu Kaal timings for your area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Rahu Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate blankets (especially dark blue or black), sesame seeds, electronics, or medicines. Help those affected by mental illness, addiction, or confusion, these are Rahu's people. Service to the confused helps clear your own confusion.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Rahu</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Rahu Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Rahave Namah", chant 108 times daily. Chanting during Rahu Kaal is especially powerful.</p>
          <p><strong>Most powerful worship:</strong> Durga Stotra or Durga Chalisa. Goddess Durga controls Rahu's energy. Regular, sincere Durga worship is the single most effective Rahu remedy. Daily Durga aarti or weekly Durga puja creates protection.</p>
          <p>Rahu responds to consistent practice more than intensity. Small daily mantras work better than occasional marathon sessions.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Keep Your Word</h4>
          <p>Rahu tempts toward manipulation and broken promises. Be scrupulously honest. Keep your word, even when it's costly. Avoid any form of deception, including self-deception. What you gain through dishonesty, Rahu takes back with interest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Avoid Shortcuts</h4>
          <p>Rahu loves shortcuts, quick schemes, easy money, fast success. Resist this temptation. Build slowly, properly, ethically. Rahu's shortcuts lead to cliff edges. What's earned properly stays; what's grabbed dishonestly crumbles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Question Your Desires</h4>
          <p>Before chasing something, ask: is this genuine need or Rahu obsession? Will achieving this actually satisfy me, or will I just want something else? Rahu mastery is discernment, the ability to see through your own illusions.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Rahu Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Meditate daily</strong>, even 10 minutes of grounding practice</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain absolute sobriety</strong>, no intoxicants, non-negotiable</li>
          <li><strong>Chant "Om Rahave Namah"</strong>, 11 or 21 times daily, or Durga mantra</li>
          <li><strong>Burn camphor weekly</strong>, or during confusion/obsessive episodes</li>
          <li><strong>Question your desires</strong>, ask "is this real or illusion?"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Rahu is mastered through grounding, sobriety, and radical honesty. The goal is to direct Rahu's tremendous drive toward what's genuinely valuable, not what merely glitters.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a negative Rahu?</h4>
          <p>Obsessive thoughts, confusion, addiction tendencies, fear and paranoia, sudden upheavals, being deceived, chasing things that never satisfy, identity confusion, and skin problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is Rahu considered malefic?</h4>
          <p>Rahu creates illusion, obsession, and disruption. But "malefic" is too simple. Rahu drives evolution by making you want things intensely, chase them, and learn through the experience. It's difficult, but it's not evil. Rahu is the shadow that makes you grow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Rahu give success?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. Rahu gives dramatic worldly success, especially in technology, entertainment, foreign matters, and unconventional fields. But Rahu success built on unethical foundation eventually collapses. Proper Rahu success is ambitious but honest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is sobriety so important for Rahu?</h4>
          <p>Rahu amplifies everything it touches. Moderate drinking for one person becomes severe addiction for someone with strong Rahu influence. Intoxicants also increase illusion and decrease discernment, exactly what Rahu affliction doesn't need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What is Rahu Kaal and should I avoid it?</h4>
          <p>Rahu Kaal is a period each day when Rahu's energy is strongest. Traditional advice is to avoid starting new things during this time. But it's also powerful for Rahu remedies, meditation during Rahu Kaal converts its energy into spiritual fuel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How long does Rahu Mahadasha last?</h4>
          <p>18 years, the longest of any planet. This period brings intense worldly experience and transformation. It's not inherently negative, but it requires consciousness, ethics, and grounding practices to navigate well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is Durga worship recommended for Rahu?</h4>
          <p>In the mythology, Goddess Durga controls Rahu. Durga represents divine protection and the slaying of illusion. She gives the strength to see through what's unreal and destroy what's not serving you. Her worship is the most powerful Rahu remedy.</p>
