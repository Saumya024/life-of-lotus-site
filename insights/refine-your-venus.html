      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">Love keeps slipping away. Relationships start with promise and end in disappointment. You wonder if there's something wrong with you, why others seem to attract partnership effortlessly while you struggle. Or maybe you're married but the spark has died, replaced by mundane coexistence. Where did the beauty go?</p>
        <p>This is often a Venus question. Venus governs love, beauty, pleasure, and the capacity to attract good things. When Venus is weak, relationships suffer. When Venus is afflicted, you may attract the wrong people or push away the right ones.</p>
        <p>Venus remedies are about cultivation, refining your capacity for beauty, harmony, and graceful connection. Unlike Mars remedies (which require action) or Saturn remedies (which require discipline), Venus remedies require appreciation, the art of savoring life.</p>

      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Venus Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Cultivate Personal Beauty</h4>
          <p>Venus responds to aesthetic care. Keep yourself clean, well-groomed, and pleasant. Wear clothes that make you feel beautiful. Use pleasant fragrances. This isn't vanity; it's Venus worship through self-care. You're cultivating the capacity to appreciate beauty by starting with yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Create Beauty Around You</h4>
          <p>Keep your living space aesthetically pleasing. Arrange flowers. Play beautiful music. Hang art that moves you. Venus energy flows through beautiful environments. Clutter and ugliness block Venus. You don't need expense, just attention to what's pleasant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Enjoy Pleasure Mindfully</h4>
          <p>Venus governs pleasure, but excess weakens it. The remedy is mindful enjoyment: taste your food, notice textures, appreciate scents. Savor rather than consume. One beautiful meal eaten with attention serves Venus more than endless mindless eating.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Face South-East, Beautify That Direction</h4>
          <p>The South-East direction is associated with Venus. Keep bedrooms and art spaces beautiful. Place fresh flowers or pleasant images there. Don't let this corner be neglected or cluttered.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Friday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Light Fragrant Incense or Candles</h4>
          <p>On Friday mornings or evenings, light fragrant incense, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, or anything pleasant. Venus appreciates refined aromas. Sit for a few minutes and simply smell. This is sensory meditation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Friday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate sweets, white clothes, rice, sugar, or white flowers on Fridays. Give to women in need, or support causes related to arts, beauty, or women's welfare. Help unmarried girls if marriage is your concern.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Venus</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Shukra Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Shukraya Namah", chant 108 times daily, preferably on Friday mornings.</p>
          <p><strong>Beej mantra:</strong> "Om Draam Dreem Draum Sah Shukraya Namah", for deeper practice or during Venus dasha.</p>
          <p><strong>Lakshmi connection:</strong> Venus connects to Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity. Lakshmi Stotra or simple Lakshmi mantras also strengthen Venus.</p>
          <p>Venus mantras should be chanted in a pleasant environment. Don't rush through them. The quality of attention matters.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Your Partner</h4>
          <p>If you're in a relationship, treat your partner with appreciation and respect. Express love openly. Notice their beauty. Venus weakens when we take partners for granted. This is the most important Venus remedy for marriage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Respect Women</h4>
          <p>Venus represents feminine energy. Respect all women in your life. Disrespecting women weakens Venus regardless of your gender. This includes how you think about women, not just how you treat them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Kindness and Artistry</h4>
          <p>Cultivate artistic expression: music, painting, poetry, dance, cooking, gardening. Create beauty as practice. Practice kindness in interactions. Venus grows through creative expression and graceful behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Balance Pleasure with Purity</h4>
          <p>Enjoy life's pleasures without drowning in them. Let magnetism come from inner beauty, not manipulation. Excessive attachment to pleasure weakens Venus. The goal is refined appreciation, not addiction to sensation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
