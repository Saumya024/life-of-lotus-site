      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">You know that anger that rises faster than you can control it. The way you snap and regret it. Or maybe it's the opposite: you can't stand up for yourself, you let people walk over you, you freeze when you should fight. Either way, something about your fire isn't working right.</p>
        <p>In Vedic astrology, this is Mars. The planet of energy, courage, action, and aggression. Too little Mars and you're a doormat. Too much and you're a wrecking ball. The goal isn't to suppress Mars or amplify it. It's to channel it, turning raw energy into focused, honorable action.</p>
        <p>Mars remedies are physical, active, and direct. They work best when combined with actual physical practice. Mars doesn't respond to gentle mantras alone. It responds to discipline.</p>

      <!-- Understanding Mangal Dosha -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Mangal Dosha: The Truth About Mars and Marriage</h2>
        <p>Mangal Dosha occurs when Mars occupies the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house from your Ascendant or Moon. It's one of the most feared, and most misunderstood, concepts in Vedic astrology.</p>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>The Reality Check</h4>
          <ul class="insight-list">
            <li><strong>Over 40% of charts</strong> have some form of Mangal Dosha. It's not rare.</li>
            <li><strong>Severity varies wildly.</strong> Mars in the 7th is different from Mars in the 12th. Sign, aspects, and overall chart context matter enormously.</li>
            <li><strong>Many Manglik people marry happily</strong> without special matching. The fear is often worse than the reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Certain placements cancel it.</strong> Jupiter's aspect, Venus conjunction, and Mars in its own sign reduce effects.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>When Mangal Dosha Actually Matters</h4>
          <p>Mars in 7th house (marriage itself) or 8th house (longevity of spouse) from Ascendant is more significant. Mars in other positions, especially with benefic aspects, is often manageable without special matching.</p>
          <p>The social stigma often creates more marriage delay than the actual planetary effect. Families reject good matches based on fear rather than proper analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Mangal Dosha Remedies</h4>
          <ul class="insight-list">
            <li><strong>Hanuman Chalisa</strong> daily, especially on Tuesdays</li>
            <li><strong>Kumbh Vivah</strong> (symbolic marriage to a tree or pot) before actual marriage, in severe cases</li>
            <li><strong>Marrying another Manglik</strong> or someone with Saturn in 7th (this is traditional matching)</li>
            <li><strong>Tuesday fasting</strong> and donating red items</li>
            <li><strong>Physical exercise</strong> to channel Mars energy constructively</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Before assuming Mangal Dosha is blocking your marriage, get a proper analysis. It's one of the most over-diagnosed issues in astrology.</p>

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Mars Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Exercise Daily (Non-Negotiable)</h4>
          <p>Physical activity is the most important Mars remedy. Mars energy that isn't used becomes destructive. Exercise, sports, martial arts, weights, running, anything that channels physical energy constructively. 30 minutes minimum. This isn't optional, it's essential. Stagnant Mars turns toxic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Maintain Your Tools and Workspace</h4>
          <p>Keep equipment sharp and functional. If you have any tools, weapons (even ceremonial), or sports equipment, maintain them well. Don't let things rust or dull. Mars appreciates readiness and precision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Reduce Stimulants</h4>
          <p>Cut down or eliminate alcohol, excessive caffeine, very spicy food, and red meat, especially if you have Mars anger issues. These inflame Mars energy. If your Mars is already too hot, don't add fuel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Face South, Strengthen South Direction</h4>
          <p>The South direction is associated with Mars. Keep this area of your home clean, strong, and heavy (place substantial furniture there). Don't leave the South weak or open. Exercise facing South if possible.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Tuesday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Light a Ghee Lamp</h4>
          <p>On Tuesday evenings, light a ghee lamp in front of Hanuman ji or facing South. This pacifies aggressive Mars while strengthening positive courage. If you don't have a Hanuman image, lighting the lamp with devotion is enough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Tuesday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate red lentils (masoor dal), red cloth, jaggery, or sports equipment on Tuesdays. Give to those who protect others: police, firefighters, security guards. Mars appreciates warriors and protectors.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Mars</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Mangal Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Mangalaya Namah" or "Om Kram Kreem Kraum Sah Bhaumaya Namah", chant 108 times, preferably on Tuesday mornings.</p>
          <p><strong>Most powerful remedy:</strong> Hanuman Chalisa. Reciting this daily, especially on Tuesdays, is the single most effective Mars remedy. Hanuman embodies Mars at its highest, strength in service of righteousness.</p>
          <p>Mars responds to discipline more than devotion. Chant with focus and regularity, not emotion.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Protect, Don't Attack</h4>
          <p>Use your energy to defend the weak, not dominate them. Stand up for others. Mars is strongest when it serves a righteous cause. Ask yourself: am I fighting because I'm right, or because I'm angry?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Younger Siblings</h4>
          <p>Mars governs younger siblings. Maintain good relationships with them. If there's conflict, work to resolve it honorably. Protect those younger than you, in family and outside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Transform Anger into Action</h4>
          <p>When angry, move your body instead of your mouth. Go for a run. Hit a punching bag. Do pushups. Channel the energy physically before it becomes words or actions you'll regret. This is Mars mastery.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Mars Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Exercise daily</strong>, minimum 30 minutes of something physical</li>
          <li><strong>Recite Hanuman Chalisa</strong>, especially on Tuesdays</li>
          <li><strong>Light a ghee lamp</strong> on Tuesday evenings</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid alcohol</strong>, especially on Tuesdays and when angry</li>
          <li><strong>Move when angry</strong>, channel the energy physically before speaking or acting</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Mars responds to discipline and honorable action. The best remedy is to live with courage and use your energy to protect, not destroy.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a weak Mars in astrology?</h4>
          <p>Lack of energy, fear, passivity, inability to stand up for yourself, chronic fatigue, blood issues, accidents through carelessness, and difficulty taking decisive action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Which day is best for Mars remedies?</h4>
          <p>Tuesday is Mars's day. Wearing red, fasting, donating red items, exercising intensely, and reciting Hanuman Chalisa on Tuesdays strengthens positive Mars energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How serious is Mangal Dosha really?</h4>
          <p>Often less serious than feared. Over 40% of charts have some form. Severity depends on specific house, sign, aspects, and overall chart. Many Manglik people marry happily. Get proper analysis before worrying.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Mars remedies help with anger issues?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. The primary remedy is physical exercise, channeling the energy constructively. Hanuman Chalisa is also powerful, it connects you to Mars energy that is strong but controlled, used in service rather than destruction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Does Mangal Dosha really affect marriage?</h4>
          <p>It can affect relationship dynamics, creating intensity, conflict, or passion. But many factors affect marriage. Mangal Dosha is one consideration, not a death sentence. The stigma often creates more problems than the actual placement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What happens when Mars is too strong?</h4>
          <p>Excessive aggression, violence, impulsiveness, accidents, inability to back down, burning bridges, and dominating rather than leading. The goal is controlled fire, not a wildfire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Is exercise really that important for Mars?</h4>
          <p>Yes. More than any other planet, Mars requires physical outlet. Mars energy that isn't used constructively becomes destructive. If you do nothing else for Mars, exercise. It's the most important remedy.</p>
