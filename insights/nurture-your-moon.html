      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">You lie awake at 3 AM, thoughts churning. Small things feel overwhelming. You snap at people you love, then feel guilty. You can't explain why you feel unsafe, just that you do. The anxiety has no clear source, but it's always there, humming beneath everything.</p>
        <p>This is often a Moon problem. The Moon governs your emotional body, your sense of inner security, your capacity to rest and digest. When it's weak or afflicted, the mind becomes restless. Sleep suffers. Emotional regulation feels impossible.</p>
        <p>Moon remedies work differently than other planetary remedies. They're not about force or action. They're about rhythm, softness, and creating the conditions for peace. The Moon responds to gentleness.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Signs of Weak Moon -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Signs Your Moon May Need Strengthening</h2>
        <p>The Moon governs mind, emotions, and your sense of being held by life. You might benefit from Moon remedies if you experience:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Emotional instability</strong> — mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks, feeling emotionally overwhelmed by small things</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep issues</strong> — insomnia, restless sleep, waking exhausted, difficulty falling asleep, vivid dreams</li>
          <li><strong>Mother-related challenges</strong> — difficult relationship with mother, feeling un-mothered, maternal figures who couldn't nurture you</li>
          <li><strong>Difficulty feeling safe</strong> — persistent worry, hypervigilance, unable to relax even in safe environments</li>
          <li><strong>Physical symptoms</strong> — water retention, digestive issues (especially absorption), hormonal imbalances, menstrual difficulties</li>
          <li><strong>Lunar sensitivity</strong> — mood shifts around full moon or new moon, feeling "off" without knowing why</li>
          <li><strong>Need for constant reassurance</strong> — asking "are you okay?" repeatedly, reading into silences, needing external validation to feel secure</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- When Moon is Too Strong -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>The Shadow Side: When Moon Energy Overwhelms</h2>
        <p>An overly strong or unbalanced Moon creates different issues:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Excessive emotional sensitivity</strong> — taking everything personally, crying easily, unable to handle criticism</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional decision-making</strong> — feelings override logic, making choices you regret when emotion passes</li>
          <li><strong>Dependency</strong> — needing others to feel okay, becoming clingy, unable to be alone</li>
          <li><strong>Moodiness</strong> — emotional weather that others have to navigate around</li>
          <li><strong>Victim patterns</strong> — feeling the world is against you, unable to take responsibility when hurt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal is a steady Moon, one that feels deeply but isn't controlled by feelings. Emotional intelligence, not emotional overwhelm.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Moon in Each House -->

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Moon Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Maintain Regular Sleep Rhythm</h4>
          <p>The Moon governs cycles. Irregular sleep weakens it. Go to bed and wake at the same times daily, yes, even on weekends. Aim to sleep by 10:30 PM when the Moon's restorative energy is strongest. The most profound Moon remedy is consistent sleep.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Create a Peaceful Sleep Environment</h4>
          <p>Keep your bedroom clean, clutter-free, and calming. Fresh bed linen, preferably white or light colors. No screens in the bedroom. The space where you sleep should feel like a sanctuary, not a storage room.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Hydrate Mindfully</h4>
          <p>The Moon rules water in the body. Drink plenty throughout the day, but not excessively at night. Avoid excess salt which causes retention. Fresh fruits with high water content, melons, cucumber, coconut water, support lunar energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Evening Wind-Down Ritual</h4>
          <p>The Moon is strongest at night. Create an evening routine: warm bath, gentle stretching, quiet reading, herbal tea. No stimulating content after 9 PM. This signals your Moon that it's time to shift from doing to being.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Monday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Offer Milk Mixed with Water</h4>
          <p>On Monday mornings, offer water mixed with a little milk to Lord Shiva or pour it at the base of a Peepal tree. This can be done at a temple or at home. The offering is symbolic, do it with reverence, not as routine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Monday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate rice, milk, white clothes, silver items, or sugar on Mondays. Give to those in need, especially women, mothers, or elderly women. Feeding birds with rice is a simple, daily alternative.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for the Moon</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Chandra Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Chandraya Namah", chant 108 times daily, ideally in the evening or at night when the Moon is visible.</p>
          <p><strong>Beej mantra:</strong> "Om Shram Shreem Shraum Sah Chandraya Namah", for deeper practice or during Moon dasha.</p>
          <p>Full moon nights are especially powerful for Moon mantras. Even sitting quietly under moonlight is beneficial.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Your Mother</h4>
          <p>The Moon represents the mother. If your relationship is healthy, cherish it. If complicated, work toward peace or at least neutrality. If she has passed, honor her memory. Mother wounds keep the Moon disturbed. Healing them, through therapy, forgiveness, or inner work, is profound lunar remedy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Gentleness</h4>
          <p>With yourself first, then others. Harsh self-talk agitates the Moon. So does harsh speech toward others. Cultivate softness in how you speak, especially when triggered. The Moon responds to kindness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Nurture Something</h4>
          <p>The Moon energy flows through nurturing. Care for plants, pets, children, or anyone who needs tending. The act of mothering, regardless of gender, strengthens the Moon. Who or what in your life needs gentle attention?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Trust Cycles</h4>
          <p>Emotions ebb and flow like Moon phases. Accept this. Don't fight the low tides or cling to high ones. Developing equanimity, the ability to feel without drowning, is the deepest Moon mastery. Everything passes. This too.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Moon Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Sleep by 10:30 PM</strong>, same time every night, non-negotiable</li>
          <li><strong>Drink warm milk</strong> before bed, add a pinch of nutmeg or turmeric if you like</li>
          <li><strong>Chant "Om Chandraya Namah"</strong>, 11 or 21 times in the evening</li>
          <li><strong>Keep your bedroom peaceful</strong>, fresh sheets, no screens, no clutter</li>
          <li><strong>Do one nurturing act daily</strong>, water a plant, call your mother, tend to something small</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Moon responds to rhythm, not intensity. Small, consistent practices matter more than grand occasional efforts. Be patient. Be gentle. That's already Moon work.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a weak Moon in astrology?</h4>
          <p>Emotional instability, anxiety, poor sleep, difficulty feeling safe, water retention, digestive issues, strained relationship with mother, mood swings around lunar phases, and needing constant reassurance from others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Which day is best for Moon remedies?</h4>
          <p>Monday is the Moon's day. Full moon nights are also powerful. Evening and night hours are lunar times. If doing one intensive weekly practice, do it on Monday evening or during full moon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What mantra helps with anxiety and emotional stability?</h4>
          <p>"Om Chandraya Namah" is most effective for emotional peace. Chant 108 times in the evening. For severe anxiety, the Chandra Beej Mantra adds power. Consistency matters more than quantity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How does the Moon affect mental health?</h4>
          <p>The Moon governs the mind. A weak Moon contributes to anxiety, depression, emotional reactivity, racing thoughts, and difficulty finding inner peace. Strengthening the Moon creates mental stability and emotional resilience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Moon remedies help with insomnia?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. The Moon rules sleep. Regular sleep times, warm milk at night, peaceful bedroom environment, evening wind-down rituals, and avoiding screens before bed are all Moon remedies that directly improve sleep.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why do I feel different around full moon?</h4>
          <p>People with strong lunar influence in their chart feel Moon phases intensely. Full moons can bring emotional peaks, insomnia, restlessness, or heightened intuition. This is normal. Track your patterns and plan accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What if I have a difficult relationship with my mother?</h4>
          <p>You don't need to reconcile or pretend everything is fine. But carrying mother wounds disturbs the Moon. The remedy is releasing the emotional charge through therapy, forgiveness practice, or inner work. This benefits your Moon, regardless of her behavior.</p>
