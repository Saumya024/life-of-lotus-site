      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">Money comes but somehow never stays. Opportunities appear, then slip away. You watch others prosper while you struggle despite working harder. There's a ceiling you keep hitting, something blocking expansion. You start to wonder if you're just unlucky, if the universe is against you.</p>
        <p>In Vedic astrology, this is often Jupiter. The planet of expansion, fortune, wisdom, and dharma. When Jupiter is weak, growth is stunted. When Jupiter is strong, things expand naturally, wealth, opportunities, understanding. Jupiter is why some people seem blessed while others struggle.</p>
        <p>But here's what most people miss: Jupiter doesn't reward wanting. It rewards deserving. Jupiter expands what you already are. If you're ethical, Jupiter expands your ethical life. If you're generous, Jupiter expands your generosity. Remedies work, but they work alongside genuine inner development.</p>

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Jupiter Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Study Wisdom Daily</h4>
          <p>Read scriptures, philosophical texts, or wisdom literature for at least 10 minutes daily. Jupiter governs higher knowledge. The act of studying wisdom strengthens Jupiter, regardless of whether you "need" the information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Keep Sacred Spaces Pure</h4>
          <p>The North-East (Ishanya) corner is Jupiter's direction. Keep it clean, preferably as a worship or study area. Place holy books, images of teachers, or sacred objects there. Don't let this corner become cluttered or neglected.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Eat Moderately and Purely</h4>
          <p>Jupiter expands; overeating shows Jupiter imbalance. Eat sattvic (pure, vegetarian, fresh) food in moderate quantities. Avoid alcohol and heavy foods, especially on Thursdays. Offer gratitude before meals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Generosity</h4>
          <p>Give something away daily, money, knowledge, time, kindness. Jupiter expands what you share. Hoarding contracts Jupiter. The spirit of giving matters more than the amount.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Thursday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Light a Ghee Lamp</h4>
          <p>On Thursday evenings, light a ghee lamp (diya) in front of your altar, the North-East direction, or an image of your guru. Yellow-colored items strengthen Jupiter. Offer yellow flowers if available.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Thursday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate yellow items: turmeric, chana dal, yellow cloth, books, or gold (if affordable). Support teachers, Brahmins, educational institutions, or temples. Service at holy places is especially powerful.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Jupiter</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Guru Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Gurave Namah", chant 108 times daily, preferably on Thursday mornings facing North-East.</p>
          <p><strong>Beej mantra:</strong> "Om Graam Greem Graum Sah Gurave Namah", for deeper practice.</p>
          <p><strong>Vishnu connection:</strong> Jupiter relates to Lord Vishnu, the preserver. Vishnu Sahasranama is powerful for Jupiter and brings overall protection and prosperity.</p>
          <p>Chant with sincerity. Jupiter responds to genuine devotion, not mechanical repetition.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Teachers and Gurus</h4>
          <p>Respect anyone who has taught you anything. Express gratitude to mentors. If you've wronged a teacher, make amends. The guru-shishya (teacher-student) relationship is Jupiter's domain. How you treat teachers determines Jupiter's blessing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Live by Dharma</h4>
          <p>Make decisions based on what's right, not just what's profitable. Jupiter governs ethical conduct. Cutting corners may bring short-term gain but long-term Jupiter affliction. When in doubt, choose the righteous path.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Guide Others</h4>
          <p>Share your knowledge freely. Mentor someone. Guide children. Jupiter strengthens in those who become teachers themselves. You don't need credentials; share what you know with those who need it.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Jupiter remedies help with wealth?</h4>

        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is Jupiter important for marriage for women?</h4>
          <p>In Vedic astrology, Jupiter is the karaka (significator) of husband for women, just as Venus is for men. A strong Jupiter supports finding a good, wise, and supportive spouse. Weak Jupiter can delay or complicate marriage for women.</p>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What happens when Jupiter is too strong?</h4>
          <p>Overconfidence, weight gain, self-righteousness, excessive spending, and believing you're above consequences. Jupiter expands everything, including flaws. The goal is wise expansion, not unchecked growth.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Can Jupiter remedies help with children?</h4>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why do some good people have weak Jupiter?</h4>
          <p>Jupiter in the chart shows accumulated merit from past lives. A weak Jupiter doesn't mean you're a bad person now; it means the account needs building. The good news: you can strengthen Jupiter through ethical living in this life.</p>
