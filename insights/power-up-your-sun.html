      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">You do good work, but no one notices. You speak, but people talk over you. You give your best, but recognition goes to someone else. Something in you knows you're meant for more, but the world doesn't seem to see it.</p>
        <p>In Vedic astrology, this is often a Sun problem. The Sun is your core self, your fire, your right to take up space in the world. When it's weak or afflicted, you become invisible, even to yourself.</p>
        <p>The good news: the Sun can be strengthened. Not through belief or wishful thinking, but through practices that align your daily life with solar energy. This guide shows you how.</p>

      <!-- Signs of Weak Sun -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Signs Your Sun May Need Strengthening</h2>
        <p>The Sun governs identity, vitality, and authority. You might benefit from Sun remedies if you experience:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Low self-confidence</strong> — feeling invisible, unrecognized, or undervalued despite your efforts</li>
          <li><strong>Vitality issues</strong> — chronic fatigue, weak bones, poor eyesight, heart concerns, weak digestion</li>
          <li><strong>Authority struggles</strong> — difficulty with bosses, government officials, or father figures; never being seen as a leader</li>
          <li><strong>Identity confusion</strong> — unclear sense of who you are, what you stand for, or where you're going</li>
          <li><strong>Recognition problems</strong> — hard work goes unnoticed, others take credit, you're passed over for promotions</li>
          <li><strong>Father-related wounds</strong> — absent, difficult, or emotionally distant father; unresolved paternal issues</li>
          <li><strong>Physical presentation</strong> — slouching, avoiding eye contact, voice that doesn't carry</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- When Sun is Too Strong -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>The Shadow Side: When Sun Energy Dominates</h2>
        <p>An overly strong or afflicted Sun creates its own problems. Watch for:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Arrogance</strong> — believing you're always right, dismissing others' perspectives</li>
          <li><strong>Dominating behavior</strong> — needing to be the center of attention, burning others with your intensity</li>
          <li><strong>Ego conflicts</strong> — clashing with other strong personalities, unable to work under anyone</li>
          <li><strong>Isolation through pride</strong> — pushing people away because you won't show vulnerability</li>
          <li><strong>Burnout</strong> — running so hot you exhaust yourself and others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal isn't maximum Sun energy. It's balanced, radiant Sun energy, warmth that illuminates without scorching.</p>

      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Sun Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Rise Before the Sun</h4>
          <p>Waking before sunrise aligns your rhythm with solar energy. You don't have to meditate or perform rituals. Just being awake as the Sun rises creates connection. The first light carries maximum vitality. If you can witness it, better. If not, be awake for it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Maintain Physical Dignity</h4>
          <p>The Sun governs how you present yourself. Bathe daily, ideally in the morning. Wear clean, neat clothes. Stand straight. Make eye contact. Your outer presentation reflects inner self-respect, and building the outer reinforces the inner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Eat Fresh, Warm Meals</h4>
          <p>The Sun governs digestion, the body's internal fire. Avoid stale, packaged, or cold food. Fresh, warm, home-cooked meals strengthen solar energy. Prefer wheat-based foods on Sundays. Eat your largest meal when the Sun is strongest, around noon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Face East</h4>
          <p>When working, making decisions, or meditating, face East. Keep the Eastern part of your home clean, uncluttered, and preferably light-colored. This direction invites solar energy. Don't sleep with your head toward the East, that's too much fire for rest.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sunday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Offer Water to the Rising Sun</h4>
          <p>At sunrise on Sunday, fill a copper vessel with water. Add a pinch of red sandalwood, kumkum, or a few drops of honey if available. Stand facing the rising Sun, lift the vessel, and pour slowly while letting the sunlight pass through the falling water. Chant "Om Suryaya Namah" as you pour. This practice, called Arghya, is the most powerful weekly Sun remedy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Sunday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate wheat, jaggery (gur), copper items, or red/orange cloth on Sundays. Give to temples, those in need, or specifically to father figures or elderly men. Donations should be made with respect, not as transactions. The spirit matters more than the amount.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for the Sun</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Surya Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Suryaya Namah", chant 108 times daily, ideally at sunrise facing East.</p>
          <p><strong>Gayatri Mantra:</strong> The Gayatri is essentially a Sun prayer. Regular chanting strengthens solar energy profoundly.</p>
          <p><strong>For serious affliction:</strong> Aditya Hridaya Stotra, recite on Sundays or during challenging periods. This is what Lord Rama chanted before defeating Ravana.</p>
          <p>Chant with a calm mind and clear intention. Mindless repetition is less effective than fewer repetitions done with full presence.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Your Father</h4>
          <p>The Sun represents the father. If your relationship is healthy, nurture it. If it's complicated, work toward peace. If he has passed or is absent, honor his memory through service to elders or father figures. Unhealed father wounds keep the Sun weak. This doesn't mean condoning harm, it means releasing the charge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Act with Integrity</h4>
          <p>The Sun governs truth and self-respect. Speak honestly. Keep commitments. Act with integrity especially when no one is watching. Every time you compromise your values, you dim your Sun. Every time you stand for what's right, you strengthen it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Lead with Warmth</h4>
          <p>Take responsibility without being asked. Volunteer to lead. But lead through warmth, not dominance. The Sun illuminates and gives life. It doesn't demand that others orbit it. Be the person who makes others feel seen, not small.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Daily Sun Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Wake before sunrise</strong>, even 10 minutes before is enough</li>
          <li><strong>Face East</strong> and drink a glass of warm water</li>
          <li><strong>Chant "Om Suryaya Namah"</strong>, 11 or 21 times with attention</li>
          <li><strong>Eat fresh, warm food</strong>, avoid stale or processed meals</li>
          <li><strong>Do one thing with integrity</strong>, make one choice that honors your values</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Consistency matters more than perfection. Even small daily practices accumulate into significant shifts over 40-90 days.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a weak Sun in astrology?</h4>
          <p>Low self-confidence, chronic fatigue, poor eyesight, bone issues, difficult relationship with father, being overlooked despite good work, authority conflicts, and feeling like you don't know who you are or what you stand for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Which day is best for Sun remedies?</h4>
          <p>Sunday is most powerful. The hour of sunrise on any day is also potent. If you can only do one intense practice weekly, do it at sunrise on Sunday. Daily small practices (waking early, integrity, presentation) work throughout the week.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What mantra should I chant to strengthen the Sun?</h4>
          <p>"Om Suryaya Namah" (108 times daily) is the standard. The Gayatri Mantra is essentially a Sun prayer. For serious affliction, the Aditya Hridaya Stotra is most powerful, particularly on Sundays.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Sun remedies help with career problems?</h4>
          <p>Yes, especially if your career problems involve lack of recognition, authority conflicts, being overlooked for leadership, or government/bureaucratic obstacles. The Sun rules visibility, respect, and professional authority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How long does it take for Sun remedies to work?</h4>
          <p>Most people notice shifts within 40-90 days of consistent practice. Some effects are immediate, like feeling more energized after waking early. Deeper changes to confidence and recognition take time. The remedies work best when combined with genuine behavioral change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can too much Sun energy be harmful?</h4>
          <p>Yes. An overly strong or imbalanced Sun creates arrogance, ego conflicts, dominating behavior, and burning out relationships. The goal is balanced radiance, not maximum intensity. If you're already arrogant, Sun remedies might not be what you need.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What if I have a difficult relationship with my father?</h4>
          <p>You don't need to reconcile or condone harm. But carrying resentment weakens your Sun. The remedy is to release the emotional charge, through therapy, forgiveness work, or serving father figures. This is for your Sun, not for him.</p>
