      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">The words are there, somewhere, but they won't come out right. You read a page three times and can't remember what it said. Ideas that seem brilliant in your head turn to mush when you try to explain them. Your mind races but accomplishes nothing, like a car spinning its wheels.</p>
        <p>This is a Mercury problem. Mercury governs your mind, the thinking, speaking, learning part. When it's weak, thoughts scatter. Communication misfires. Learning becomes struggle. When it's sharp, you think clearly, speak persuasively, and absorb information like a sponge.</p>
        <p>Mercury remedies are about clarity and truth. Unlike the other planets, Mercury is neutral, it becomes what it touches. The remedy isn't just strengthening Mercury. It's purifying what Mercury channels.</p>

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Mercury Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Write Every Day</h4>
          <p>Mercury strengthens through expression. Journal, take notes, write morning pages. The content doesn't matter; the act of putting thoughts into words sharpens Mercury. Maintain clear handwriting if writing by hand, or organized digital notes if typing. Messy expression reflects messy thinking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Keep Your Mental Space Organized</h4>
          <p>A cluttered desk reflects a cluttered mind. Organize your workspace, books, and devices. Delete unnecessary files. Clear your browser tabs. Mercury governs information, and how you manage information reflects how Mercury functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Eat Green and Light</h4>
          <p>Green vegetables (especially leafy greens), moong dal, and coriander support Mercury. Avoid heavy, tamasic foods that dull the mind. Vegetarian diet supports Mercury clarity. Don't overeat, a full stomach makes for a slow mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Face North When Working</h4>
          <p>The North direction is associated with Mercury. Face North when studying, writing, or doing intellectual work. Keep your study or work desk in the North, neat and organized.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Wednesday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Feed Birds</h4>
          <p>Feed parrots or other green birds on Wednesdays if accessible. Otherwise, scatter grains for any birds. This traditional remedy connects to Mercury's quality of gathering and distributing information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Wednesday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate green moong dal, coriander, green cloth, books, or stationery on Wednesdays. Support education, libraries, or literacy causes. Mercury appreciates intellectual charity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Mercury</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Budh Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Budhaya Namah", chant 108 times daily, preferably on Wednesday mornings before studying or working.</p>
          <p><strong>Beej mantra:</strong> "Om Braam Breem Braum Sah Budhaya Namah", for deeper practice.</p>
          <p><strong>Vishnu connection:</strong> Mercury relates to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu Sahasranama benefits Mercury, especially for those in business or seeking preservation of knowledge.</p>
          <p>Chant Mercury mantras with clear pronunciation. Mercury responds to precision.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Speak Truth, Avoid Gossip</h4>
          <p>Mercury is neutral; it amplifies what you channel through it. Lies and gossip corrupt Mercury. Truthful speech purifies it. Every time you gossip, you weaken Mercury. Every time you speak truthfully even when difficult, you strengthen it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Siblings and Friends</h4>
          <p>Mercury governs siblings and close friends. Maintain good relationships with brothers, sisters, and cousins. If there's conflict, work toward resolution. How you treat peers reflects Mercury's condition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Stay Curious, Keep Learning</h4>
          <p>Mercury loves learning. Read widely. Take courses. Stay curious about new topics. A mind that stops learning is a Mercury going dormant. It doesn't matter what you learn, the act of learning is the remedy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Communicate with Clarity</h4>
          <p>Practice saying what you mean clearly. Don't ramble. Don't withhold. Clear, honest communication is Mercury training. Before important conversations, take a moment to organize your thoughts.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is truthful speech a Mercury remedy?</h4>
          <p>Mercury is neutral; it amplifies what passes through it. Lies corrupt the channel. Truth purifies it. Every lie weakens Mercury; every truth strengthens it. This is why gossip and dishonesty are Mercury afflictions.</p>
