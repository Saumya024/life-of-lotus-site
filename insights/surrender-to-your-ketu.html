        <p class="insight-subtitle">Release what's done. Walk the inner path. Find liberation.</p>
      </header>

      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">You achieve things, but they feel hollow. You're surrounded by people, but feel utterly alone. There's a part of you that stands apart, watching life without fully participating in it. You wonder if something's wrong with you, why you can't care about what everyone else cares about.</p>
        <p>This is Ketu. The shadow planet of detachment, past karma, and spiritual liberation. Where Rahu creates insatiable desire, Ketu creates inexplicable disinterest. It's the part of you that has already learned something, perhaps in past lives, and no longer needs to chase it in this one.</p>
        <p>Ketu remedies are different from other planetary remedies. You don't "strengthen" Ketu. You work with it by walking the path it reveals, by embracing the spiritual purpose of your detachment rather than fighting it.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Understanding Ketu -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Understanding Ketu: The Liberator</h2>
        <p>Ketu is the South Node of the Moon, the opposite point from Rahu. While Rahu is the head (endless desire), Ketu is the tail (wisdom from completion). Consider:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Ketu represents what you've mastered in past lives</strong>, skills and experiences that feel oddly familiar</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu creates natural detachment</strong>, things in Ketu's domain don't excite you even when achieved</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu points toward moksha</strong>, spiritual liberation, release from the cycle of desire</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu gives without asking</strong>, effortless competence in its areas, though without satisfaction from them</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu strips illusions</strong>, showing you what doesn't matter, sometimes painfully</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The confusion of Ketu: you're good at things you don't care about, and what you care about (Rahu) feels just out of reach. This is by design. Ketu asks you to find meaning beyond worldly achievement.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Signs of Ketu Issues -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Signs Your Ketu May Need Attention</h2>
        <p>Ketu creates distinctive patterns of detachment and otherworldliness. You might benefit from Ketu remedies if you experience:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Feeling lost or directionless</strong> — no clear purpose despite searching, nothing feels worth pursuing</li>
          <li><strong>Excessive detachment</strong> — inability to connect emotionally, watching life from outside</li>
          <li><strong>Mysterious health issues</strong> — problems doctors can't diagnose or explain, symptoms without clear cause</li>
          <li><strong>Past trauma surfacing</strong> — old wounds that won't heal, memories that keep returning</li>
          <li><strong>Material dissatisfaction</strong> — achieving goals but feeling empty when you do</li>
          <li><strong>Perpetual outsider feeling</strong> — never quite belonging anywhere, even in your own family</li>
          <li><strong>Spiritual intensity</strong> — strong pull toward meditation, withdrawal, or renunciation</li>
          <li><strong>Unexplained fears</strong> — phobias without clear origin, ancestral anxieties</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Ketu Mahadasha: The 7-Year Release</h2>
        <p>Ketu's major period (Mahadasha) lasts 7 years. It brings completion, release, and preparation for new cycles.</p>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>What Ketu Mahadasha Brings</h4>
          <ul class="insight-list">
            <li>Things falling away that are no longer needed</li>

            <li>Detachment from what you used to value</li>
            <li>Completion of karmic patterns</li>

          <h4>Navigating Ketu Mahadasha</h4>
          <ul class="insight-list">
            <li><strong>Don't cling.</strong> What's leaving is supposed to leave. Resistance increases suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace spiritual practice.</strong> This is when meditation and inner work are most supported.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplify your life.</strong> Ketu rewards simplicity. Excess becomes burden.</li>
            <li><strong>Honor endings.</strong> Relationships, phases, or projects ending are completing karma.</li>
            <li><strong>Ancestor work.</strong> Connect with lineage, do Shraddha rituals, heal family patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve without attachment.</strong> Selfless service aligns with Ketu's energy.</li>

      <!-- Ketu in Each House -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Ketu in Each House: A Brief Guide</h2>
        <p>Where your Ketu sits shows where you've mastered past karma and where detachment naturally occurs:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Ketu in 1st House:</strong> Otherworldly personality. May seem absent. Strong spiritual potential. Identity is a flexible concept.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 2nd House:</strong> Detached from family wealth. Speaks differently. Past life wealth karma. May have unusual dietary needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 3rd House:</strong> Communication has depth. Siblings karmic. Skills come easily but don't satisfy. Artistic abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 4th House:</strong> Detached from homeland. Mother may be spiritual or absent. Peace found in solitude, not home.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 5th House:</strong> Children have karmic connection. Creativity detached. Romance doesn't follow normal patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 6th House:</strong> Good for healing work. Enemies dissolve. Health may be mysterious. Service-oriented.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 7th House:</strong> Marriage is karmic, possibly difficult. Partner may be spiritual. Business detachment.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 8th House:</strong> Strong occult abilities. Transformation happens naturally. Inheritance from past lives. Research depth.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 9th House:</strong> Questions all belief. Father karmic. Higher learning is intuitive, not academic. Spiritual but not religious.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 10th House:</strong> Career indifference. May work in healing, research, or spiritual fields. Success without attachment.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 11th House:</strong> Friends are karmic. Gains come unexpectedly. Goals feel meaningless when achieved.</li>
          <li><strong>Ketu in 12th House:</strong> Strong for moksha. Foreign lands or isolation natural. Spiritual life comes easily. Final liberation potential.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Ketu Remedies: A Complete Guide</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Silence and Meditation (Essential)</h4>
          <p>Ketu responds to inner stillness more than any other planet. Regular meditation, periods of silence, and contemplative practices align you with Ketu's spiritual nature. Even 10 minutes of silent sitting helps. For Ketu, doing nothing consciously is powerful practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Keep Sacred Spaces Clean</h4>
          <p>Maintain cleanliness in meditation areas, temples, and spiritual spaces. Keep shoes organized and pathways clear. Ketu appreciates simplicity and purity in environment. Cluttered sacred space blocks Ketu's subtle energy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Eat Simply</h4>
          <p>Prefer simple, easily digestible meals. Avoid fermented, stale, or heavily processed foods. Occasional fasting supports Ketu. The simpler your diet, the clearer your spiritual channel. Don't use food for emotional comfort.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>South-West Direction</h4>
          <p>Like Rahu, Ketu relates to the South-West. Keep meditation spaces uncluttered there. This direction supports spiritual practice and ancestral connection.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Special Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Feed Stray Dogs</h4>
          <p>Ketu is associated with dogs in Vedic tradition. Feeding stray dogs or caring for abandoned animals is a powerful Ketu remedy. Do this with genuine compassion, not as transaction. The animals others ignore are Ketu's children.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Offer Incense During Meditation</h4>
          <p>Light incense, sandalwood or camphor, during meditation. The rising smoke represents the release of attachment. This creates atmosphere for Ketu's subtle energy to flow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Ketu Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate brown or grey cloth, simple blankets, or basic foods. Support spiritual seekers, monasteries, or those who have renounced worldly life. Help the homeless, those who own nothing. These are Ketu's people.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Ketu</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Ketu Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Ketave Namah", chant 108 times daily, preferably during meditation.</p>
          <p><strong>Ganesha connection:</strong> Lord Ganesha is Ketu's presiding deity. "Om Gam Ganapataye Namah" helps navigate Ketu's obstacles and reveals the path forward when you feel lost.</p>
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> For Ketu, silent meditation is often more powerful than mantra repetition. Ketu responds to emptiness more than activity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Honor Your Ancestors</h4>
          <p>Ketu connects to ancestral karma. Perform Shraddha rituals, honor departed family members, and heal family patterns. Light a lamp for ancestors. What's unresolved in your lineage shows through Ketu. Ancestral healing is Ketu work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Release Past Grudges</h4>
          <p>Ketu holds past karma. Consciously release old resentments, forgive those who have wronged you, and let go of what no longer serves. Holding on strengthens negative Ketu. Freedom comes through letting go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Humility and Detachment</h4>
          <p>Detach from pride, ego, and the need for recognition. Ketu strips away what's false. Those who surrender to this process grow spiritually; those who resist suffer. Walk the inner path quietly, without announcement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Serve Without Attachment</h4>
          <p>Selfless service aligns perfectly with Ketu. Help others without expecting recognition, gratitude, or reward. This is karma yoga, action without attachment to results. Ketu mastery is doing what's needed without needing anything back.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Ketu Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Meditate in silence</strong>, even 10 minutes daily, just sit</li>
          <li><strong>Chant "Om Ketave Namah"</strong>, 11 or 21 times, or simply sit in presence</li>
          <li><strong>Feed a stray dog weekly</strong>, with genuine compassion</li>
          <li><strong>Honor your ancestors</strong>, light a lamp or offer water for departed souls</li>
          <li><strong>Let go of one attachment</strong>, consciously release something you're gripping</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ketu asks for surrender, not control. The best remedy is to walk the spiritual path it reveals and trust that what falls away was meant to go. Liberation is on the other side of letting go.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- The Gift of Ketu -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>The Gift of Ketu: What It Offers</h2>
        <p>Ketu isn't just about loss and detachment. Well-integrated Ketu gives:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Spiritual depth</strong> — natural access to meditative states and inner peace</li>
          <li><strong>Psychic abilities</strong> — intuition, subtle perception, knowing without knowing how</li>
          <li><strong>Healing capacity</strong> — ability to help others release and transform</li>
          <li><strong>Research abilities</strong> — deep focus without worldly distraction</li>
          <li><strong>Moksha potential</strong> — the possibility of liberation in this lifetime</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom from manipulation</strong> — when you don't need worldly things, you can't be controlled</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The outsider feeling isn't punishment. It's preparation for a different kind of belonging, one that transcends the ordinary.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a negative Ketu?</h4>
          <p>Feeling lost or directionless, excessive detachment from life, difficulty connecting emotionally, mysterious health issues, past trauma resurfacing, inability to enjoy achievements, and perpetually feeling like an outsider.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is Ketu associated with spirituality?</h4>
          <p>Ketu represents completion of worldly desire. When you've already mastered something (in past lives), you naturally turn inward. Ketu's detachment from the material creates space for the spiritual. It's the planet of the monk, the mystic, the seeker.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Ketu cause health problems?</h4>
          <p>Ketu can cause mysterious health issues that resist diagnosis, symptoms without clear physical cause, and conditions requiring spiritual as well as medical attention. If doctors can't find anything wrong but you're suffering, consider Ketu factors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why do I feel like I don't belong anywhere?</h4>
          <p>Strong Ketu creates this feeling. You're meant to belong somewhere beyond the ordinary, to a spiritual community, a path, or simply to yourself. The outsider feeling is preparation for a different kind of home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How long is Ketu Mahadasha?</h4>
          <p>7 years. It brings completion of cycles, spiritual deepening, and release of what's no longer needed. It's shorter than Rahu (18 years) because Ketu's work is about ending, not accumulating.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why is ancestor work important for Ketu?</h4>
          <p>Ketu carries ancestral karma. Unresolved patterns from your lineage, whether you know about them or not, can show up as Ketu difficulties. Honoring ancestors and healing family patterns directly addresses this karmic load.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Ketu give worldly success?</h4>
          <p>Ketu can give success in spiritual, research, or healing fields. It can also give effortless competence in its areas. But Ketu success is peculiar: you achieve things without trying and without satisfaction. The success is real; the attachment to it isn't.</p>
