      <!-- Intro -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <p class="insight-intro">Everything takes longer than it should. You work hard, but results don't come. Younger people pass you by. You feel stuck, heavy, limited. Like you're walking through mud while others sprint past on solid ground. The question forms in your mind: <em>Why is life so hard for me?</em></p>
        <p>This is often Saturn. And here's what most people get wrong: Saturn isn't punishing you. Saturn is teaching you. The planet of karma, time, and discipline doesn't respond to mantras alone. It responds to how you live.</p>
        <p>Saturn remedies are the least glamorous and the most powerful. They work, but only if you do.</p>

      <!-- Understanding Saturn -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Understanding Saturn: The Misunderstood Teacher</h2>
        <p>Saturn gets a bad reputation in astrology. People fear Sade Sati and Saturn transits. But consider this:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li>Saturn rules <strong>time itself</strong>. Nothing lasting is built without time.</li>
          <li>Saturn governs <strong>discipline</strong>. Every achievement worth having requires it.</li>
          <li>Saturn represents <strong>karma</strong>. The results of your actions, positive and negative.</li>
          <li>Saturn brings <strong>wisdom through experience</strong>. The hard-won kind, not the borrowed kind.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Saturn doesn't hate you. Saturn is the examiner who doesn't grade on a curve. Do the work, get the results. Skip the work, face consequences. It's impersonal, but it's fair.</p>

      <!-- Signs of Weak Saturn -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Signs Your Saturn May Need Attention</h2>
        <p>Saturn issues show up as chronic patterns, not temporary setbacks:</p>
        <ul class="insight-list">
          <li><strong>Chronic delays</strong> — everything takes longer, results don't come despite consistent effort</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of discipline</strong> — can't stick to routines, procrastination wins, plans fall apart</li>
          <li><strong>Depression and hopelessness</strong> — persistent heaviness, feeling stuck with no way forward</li>
          <li><strong>Physical issues</strong> — joint pain, bone problems, chronic conditions, premature aging</li>
          <li><strong>Authority problems</strong> — conflicts with bosses, government, legal troubles, never being promoted</li>
          <li><strong>Worker/servant issues</strong> — staff don't respect you, difficulty managing people "below" you</li>
          <li><strong>Karmic repetition</strong> — same problems keep returning, patterns you can't break</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Sade Sati Section -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Sade Sati: The 7.5 Year Test</h2>
        <p>Sade Sati occurs when Saturn transits through the 12th, 1st, and 2nd houses from your Moon sign. It comes roughly every 29 years and lasts 7.5 years.</p>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>The Three Phases</h4>
          <p><strong>Rising Phase (12th from Moon):</strong> Mental pressure, hidden anxieties, sleep issues, expenses increase. The test is beginning.</p>
          <p><strong>Peak Phase (1st from Moon):</strong> Maximum intensity. Health challenges, identity questioning, major life restructuring. This is where transformation happens.</p>
          <p><strong>Setting Phase (2nd from Moon):</strong> Family pressures, financial concerns, speech issues. The test is completing, integration begins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>How to Navigate Sade Sati</h4>
          <ul class="insight-list">
            <li><strong>Don't fight it.</strong> Resistance increases suffering. Accept that this is a period of restructuring.</li>
            <li><strong>Work harder, not smarter.</strong> Saturn doesn't reward shortcuts. Put in genuine effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve others.</strong> Service is Saturn's love language. Help those below you in status.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain routines.</strong> Discipline protects you. Keep your structures even when they feel heavy.</li>
            <li><strong>Hanuman Chalisa.</strong> This is the most powerful Sade Sati remedy. Daily recitation creates protection.</li>

      <!-- Saturn in Each House -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Saturn in Each House: A Brief Guide</h2>

      <!-- Remedies -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Saturn Remedies: What Actually Works</h2>

        <h3>Daily Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Rise Early, Keep Routines</h4>
          <p>Saturn rewards discipline. Wake at the same time daily. Stick to schedules. Respect time, yours and others'. Punctuality itself is a Saturn remedy. If you can't manage your own time, Saturn will manage it for you, less pleasantly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Keep the Lowest Things Clean</h4>
          <p>Saturn rules what's below, feet, floors, storage areas, workers. Keep your footwear organized. Clean the floors yourself sometimes. Maintain storage areas. Don't neglect what's "beneath" you. Saturn watches how you treat the lowest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Eat Simply</h4>
          <p>Avoid extravagance in food. Simple, clean meals please Saturn. Absolutely avoid intoxicants, especially alcohol. Saturn punishes excess and rewards simplicity. Fasting on Saturdays is powerful but optional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Face West, Manage Iron</h4>
          <p>The West direction is associated with Saturn. Keep iron objects tidy and properly stored. Don't leave iron items scattered or rusty. Heavy furniture can go in the West or Southwest.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Saturday Practices</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Light a Sesame Oil Lamp</h4>
          <p>On Saturday evenings, light a lamp with sesame oil or mustard oil. Place it under a Peepal tree if accessible, or in your home facing West. This is one of the most traditional and effective Saturn remedies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Saturday Donations</h4>
          <p>Donate black sesame seeds (til), iron items, black blankets, shoes, or oil on Saturdays. Give to the poor, disabled, elderly, or those who serve (cleaners, guards, laborers). How you give matters, with respect, not superiority.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mantras for Saturn</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Saturn Mantras</h4>
          <p><strong>Simple mantra:</strong> "Om Sham Shanicharaya Namah", chant 108 times daily, preferably on Saturday mornings.</p>
          <p><strong>Shani Stotra:</strong> Powerful for Saturn transits and Sade Sati. Recite on Saturdays.</p>
          <p><strong>Hanuman Chalisa:</strong> This is the most powerful Saturn remedy. Hanuman protects from Saturn's harshness. Daily recitation, especially during difficult Saturn periods, creates a shield.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Behavioral Remedies</h3>
        
        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Respect Elders and Workers</h4>
          <p>Honor elderly people. Respect workers, servants, and the marginalized. Saturn rules the downtrodden. How you treat those "below" you determines Saturn's favor. This is not optional, it's the most important remedy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Practice Patience Without Bitterness</h4>
          <p>Accept delays without becoming bitter. Work steadily without expecting quick results. The moment you get angry at delays, you're failing Saturn's test. Patience isn't passive waiting, it's working while you wait.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="remedy-card">
          <h4>Serve Without Pride</h4>
          <p>Do service (seva) without expecting recognition or gratitude. Help the poor, disabled, or elderly. Visit old age homes. Donate anonymously. Saturn is pleased by humble service, not grand gestures with your name attached.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Simple Routine -->
      <section class="insight-section insight-highlight">
        <h2>A Simple Saturn Routine</h2>
        <p>If you can only do a few things, do these:</p>
        <ol class="insight-numbered">
          <li><strong>Wake at the same time daily</strong>, discipline is the foundation of everything</li>
          <li><strong>Recite Hanuman Chalisa</strong>, especially on Tuesdays and Saturdays</li>
          <li><strong>Donate something black or iron</strong> on Saturdays, sesame, cloth, or service</li>
          <li><strong>Respect workers and elders</strong>, treat them with genuine kindness, not charity</li>
          <li><strong>Accept delays gracefully</strong>, patience without bitterness is itself the remedy</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Saturn tests character. The best remedy is to work hard, stay humble, and serve without expecting quick results. If you're looking for a shortcut, you've already failed Saturn's test.</p>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="insight-section">
        <h2>Common Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What are the signs of a weak Saturn in astrology?</h4>
          <p>Chronic delays despite effort, lack of discipline, joint and bone pain, depression, career stagnation, legal troubles, difficulty with authority, and the same problems repeating in cycles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>What is Sade Sati and when does it happen?</h4>
          <p>Sade Sati is Saturn's 7.5-year transit through the 12th, 1st, and 2nd houses from your Moon sign. It occurs roughly every 29 years. It brings restructuring, tests, and karmic lessons. The intensity depends on your natal Saturn and how you respond.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Which day is best for Saturn remedies?</h4>
          <p>Saturday is Saturn's day. Wearing black or dark blue, fasting, donating black items, and serving the poor on Saturdays strengthens Saturn's positive influence and reduces afflictions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Why does Saturn delay everything?</h4>
          <p>Saturn delays to ensure readiness and maturity. It tests whether you've actually done the work or just want results without effort. What Saturn gives after the delay tends to last. What comes without Saturn's blessing often crumbles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Is Saturn always bad in a birth chart?</h4>
          <p>No. Saturn becomes a great benefic when you align with its energy. It rewards discipline, patience, service, and ethical conduct with lasting success, respect, and wisdom. The difficulty comes from resisting Saturn's lessons, not from Saturn itself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>How do I know if I'm in Sade Sati?</h4>
          <p>Check your Moon sign (not Sun sign). When Saturn transits through the sign before your Moon, through your Moon sign, and through the sign after your Moon, you're in Sade Sati. An astrologer can tell you the exact dates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight-faq">
          <h4>Can Saturn remedies change my karma?</h4>
          <p>Remedies don't erase karma. They help you navigate it with more grace. Service and discipline create good karma that balances past karma. Saturn responds to genuine transformation, not rituals performed without inner change.</p>
