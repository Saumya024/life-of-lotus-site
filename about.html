  <section class="about-section about-section-1">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>My Path to Astrology</h2>
      
      <p>I did not arrive at Vedic astrology as a subject of interest. I arrived through lived experience.</p>
      
      <p>Loss, confusion, grief, and prolonged inner upheaval shaped important chapters of my life. During those phases, clarity disappeared, decisions felt heavy, and relationships tested both direction and identity. Strength did not return through sudden insight or emotional release. It returned slowly, through endurance, reflection, and the quiet rebuilding of self-trust.</p>
      
      <p>Astrology entered my life during this terrain. Not as belief, comfort, or escape, but as a framework to understand why certain patterns repeat, why specific struggles arise when they do, and what aspects of life must be accepted versus consciously worked through.</p>
      
      <p>Life of Lotus grew from this lived engagement with suffering, inquiry, and gradual clarity. It carries the imprint of experience, not abstraction.</p>

  <section class="about-section about-section-2">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>What Is Vedic Astrology?</h2>
      
      <p>Vedic astrology, also known as Jyotish, is not a tool for reassurance or entertainment. It is a karmic map.</p>
      
      <p>Rooted in the sidereal zodiac and ancient Sanskrit texts, Vedic astrology studies karma, time, and consequence with precision. It reveals:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>long-standing karmic patterns embedded in the birth chart</li>
        <li>unresolved tendencies carried across life phases</li>
        <li>areas where effort is required versus areas where surrender is necessary</li>
        <li>the nature of one's responsibilities, lessons, and limits</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The birth chart reflects prārabdha karma, what is already in motion. It shows where awareness, discipline, and right action can soften or redirect experience. Some events unfold despite resistance. Others demand conscious participation. Wisdom lies in knowing the difference.</p>

  <!-- About Section 3: How I Practice Vedic Astrology -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-3">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>How I Practice Vedic Astrology</h2>
      
      <p>My work as a Vedic astrologer focuses on understanding:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>why a pattern exists</li>
        <li>how long it persists</li>
        <li>what strengthens it</li>
        <li>and what weakens its grip</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I use dashā systems, planetary periods, transits, and prashna, horary astrology, with restraint. Their purpose is not fear or false certainty, but orientation, so life can be navigated with steadiness, dignity, and responsibility.</p>
      
      <p>Birth chart readings here are not about control.<br>They are about right response.</p>

  <!-- About Section 4: The Lens I Bring to Astrology Consultations -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-4">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>The Lens I Bring to Astrology Consultations</h2>
      
      <p>My approach emerges from an uncommon convergence.</p>
      
      <p>Years in product management trained me to think in systems, consequences, and long-term impact. Training in social sciences and business deepened my understanding of human behaviour, conditioning, and power structures. Over a decade of Vipassana practice cultivated the capacity to observe without distortion, sit with discomfort, and act without impulsiveness.</p>
      
      <p>Alongside this, I study Vedic astrology as a discipline of causality, not symbolism alone. Planetary placements are not treated as labels, but as living indicators of samskāras, karmic impressions, tendencies, and unfinished karmic loops.</p>
      
      <p>This convergence allows me to read birth charts with:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>clarity without projection</li>
        <li>seriousness without fear</li>
        <li>compassion without indulgence</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Charts are always interpreted in relation to lived reality, psychological patterns, and ethical responsibility.</p>

  <!-- About Section 5: What You Can Expect from a Vedic Astrology Reading -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-5">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>What You Can Expect from a Vedic Astrology Reading</h2>
      
      <p>A consultation with Life of Lotus is not passive listening. It is active engagement.</p>
      
      <p>Together, we examine:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>career and purpose, work aligned with karmic design</li>
        <li>relationships, why patterns repeat and how to navigate them consciously</li>
        <li>timing, when to act, when to wait, when to release</li>
        <li>inner work, psychological or spiritual blocks that require attention</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>You leave not with vague predictions, but with practical frameworks that support clarity, courage, and conscious choice.</p>

  <!-- About Section 6: Why This Work Matters -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-6">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>
      
      <p>Vedic astrology is a profound and precise knowledge system. It carries centuries of insight into karma, time, consequence, and human nature. Yet today, it is often diluted, reduced to shortcuts, casual readings, or practiced without depth or accountability.</p>
      
      <p>This dilution causes harm.</p>
      
      <p>When astrology loses discipline, trust erodes. When it loses responsibility, it becomes noise. When it becomes noise, those who could genuinely benefit from it turn away.</p>
      
      <p>Life of Lotus exists to stand against that erosion.</p>
      
      <p>I built this practice to restore Vedic astrology to its rightful place, as serious, ethical work that respects both human agency and karmic law. This work does not promise escape from difficulty. It supports understanding, maturity, and conscious movement through life as it is.</p>
      
      <p>I built this work with intention.<br>I continue it with responsibility.<br>I offer it with respect, for the individual seeking guidance, and for the knowledge itself.</p>
