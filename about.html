      <div class="about-section-content">
      <p>I did not come to Vedic astrology as an intellectual pursuit. I came because the same questions kept repeating in my own life, and conventional answers stopped working.</p>
      
      <p>Loss, prolonged uncertainty, emotional strain, and periods of internal conflict shaped important phases of my life. During those years, clarity felt impossible to reach. Decisions felt heavier than the situation seemed to warrant. Relationships carried familiar tensions despite changing circumstances. I kept wondering: why does this keep happening? What am I missing?</p>
      
      <p>Astrology entered my life during this terrain, not as belief or escape, but as a way to understand why similar situations kept resurfacing, why timing mattered more than effort in certain phases, and why some problems resolved only when approached differently rather than harder. What I found was not vague symbolism. It was a rigorous framework that explained patterns I had already lived through, including their timing and repetition.</p>
      
      <p>Life of Lotus grew from this lived confrontation with repetition, uncertainty, and the search for clarity that holds up under pressure.</p>

        <p>A consultation with Life of Lotus addresses questions people often struggle to resolve on their own: whether to change jobs now or wait, why the same relationship dynamics repeat despite new partners, why family pressure intensifies at certain ages, or why health issues flare during specific periods.</p>
        
        <p>Sessions are collaborative. I work with you to make sense of what you are experiencing. You are encouraged to ask questions, challenge interpretations, and engage actively rather than receive answers passively.</p>
        
        <p>You leave with specific insight, clearer priorities, and concrete guidance on how to move through the phase you are in, with a renewed sense of agency over your own life.</p>
        
        <p>Most people come in when they feel stuck or overwhelmed, but clarity often matters most before decisions become urgent.</p>

      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>Modern life has removed many of the buffers that once helped people course-correct early. Families are smaller. Support systems are fragmented. People live farther from nature, elders, and shared rhythms. Patterns that once resolved quietly now accumulate into burnout, breakdown, or illness.</p>
        
        <p>I have watched people carry unanswered questions for years, wondering why certain struggles do not resolve, why effort does not translate into relief, and why the same painful lessons keep repeating. That accumulation takes a real toll.</p>
        
        <p>Vedic astrology offers early visibility into patterns, pressure points, and turning phases, so action can be taken before crisis becomes inevitable.</p>

      </button>
      
      <div class="about-section-content">
      <p>Vedic astrology, also known as Jyotish, is a predictive system used to understand repeating life patterns, decision timing, and periods of increased challenge or opportunity.</p>
      
      <p>It examines how tendencies formed early in life, family conditioning, and inherited patterns activate at specific periods. Charts often reveal why one person repeatedly attracts unstable partnerships, why another faces career stagnation despite competence, or why health issues surface under stress rather than randomly.</p>
      
      <p>A birth chart shows what is already set in motion and when particular themes become active. Some events unfold regardless of effort. Others respond strongly to timing and preparedness. Vedic astrology exists to clarify this distinction, so you are not left guessing why life feels harder than it should.</p>

      <div class="about-section-content">
      <p>My work focuses on identifying patterns that repeat unless addressed, periods when life pushes for change, and phases where restraint prevents damage.</p>
      
      <p>I use planetary periods, transits, and focused question-based techniques to understand what is likely to unfold, how intensely it may express, and what response reduces unnecessary loss. Charts often point to specific periods, triggers, and outcomes, not just themes. This allows people to prepare rather than react.</p>
      
      <p>Some patterns soften through effort. Others must be navigated with preparation rather than resistance.</p>
      
      <p>Astrology here does not replace doctors, therapists, or professional advice. It flags vulnerabilities before they harden, so corrective steps can be taken in time.</p>
      
      <p>I do not offer dramatic predictions or false certainty. I offer clarity that helps people make better decisions when the stakes are real, along with compassion for what they are carrying.</p>

      <div class="about-section-content">
      <p>My approach is shaped by how I have lived and worked.</p>
      
      <p>Years in product management trained me to evaluate trade-offs, long-term consequences, and imperfect decisions made under pressure. Training in social sciences and business deepened my understanding of power dynamics, emotional conditioning, and behavioural patterns. Over a decade of Vipassana practice strengthened my ability to observe without reacting and to sit with complexity without forcing answers.</p>
      
      <p>This lens allows me to read charts without projection or exaggeration. Patterns are examined in relation to real life circumstances, not isolated symbols.</p>
      
      <p>I hold your questions with care. The work we do together is confidential, serious, and without judgment.</p>
