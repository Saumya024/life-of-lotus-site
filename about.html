  <section class="about-section about-section-1">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
      
      <p>Life of Lotus exists to restore clarity, responsibility, and thoughtful decision-making to astrology.</p>
      
      <p>In a world saturated with noise, prediction, and quick fixes, this work returns astrology to its truest role — a lens to understand patterns, timing, and choice. The vision is simple: help people think more clearly about their lives, especially at moments that matter.</p>
      
      <p>The mission is to offer astrology as a grounded, reflective practice — one that supports awareness, agency, and conscious action, rather than fear or dependence.</p>

  <!-- About Section 2: Career Journey -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-2">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>From Diverse Paths to Focused Work</h2>
      
      <p>My journey into astrology did not begin in isolation. It unfolded alongside years of work in product management, formal training in business and social sciences, and sustained inner practice through Vipassana meditation.</p>
      
      <p>Each of these paths sharpened a different faculty — analytical thinking, systems awareness, human behaviour, discipline, and observation. Over time, they converged into a single realisation: the same clarity applied to building products and understanding societies is deeply needed in how people approach life decisions.</p>
      
      <p>Choosing astrology as a vocation was not a departure from these domains, but a continuation of them — expressed through a more human, reflective, and symbolic language.</p>

  <!-- About Section 3: Why & How Astrology -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-3">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>Why Astrology, and How It's Practised Here</h2>
      
      <p>Astrology, when approached with depth and responsibility, reveals cycles, patterns, and windows of possibility. It invites pause. It sharpens perspective. It asks better questions.</p>
      
      <p>At Life of Lotus, astrology is practised as a tool for reflection and timing, not prediction. Charts are read with openness and precision, always in dialogue with the individual's lived reality.</p>
      
      <p>The work focuses on:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>understanding patterns rather than fixing outcomes</li>
        <li>recognising timing rather than forcing action</li>
        <li>supporting clarity rather than providing certainty</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The aim is not to tell you what to do, but to help you see clearly enough to decide well.</p>

  <!-- About Section 4: Vision for Tomorrow -->
  <section class="about-section about-section-4">
    <div class="about-content">
      <h2>A Vision for What Comes Next</h2>
      
      <p>The deeper vision of Life of Lotus is to normalise astrology as a thinking person's discipline — one that sits comfortably alongside psychology, strategy, and self-inquiry.</p>
      
      <p>This is work for people who value awareness over answers, responsibility over reassurance, and growth over shortcuts. As the practice evolves, the intention remains steady: to create spaces where insight leads to steadiness, and clarity leads to meaningful action.</p>
