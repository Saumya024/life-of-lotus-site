        <p>A consultation addresses questions people often struggle to resolve on their own: whether to change jobs now or wait, why the same relationship dynamics repeat despite new partners, why family pressure intensifies at certain ages, or why health issues flare during specific periods.</p>
        
        <p>Sessions are collaborative. I work with you to make sense of what you're experiencing. You're encouraged to ask questions, challenge interpretations, and engage actively rather than receive answers passively.</p>
        
        <p><strong>You leave with:</strong> specific insight into your situation, clearer priorities for the phase you're in, and concrete guidance you can act on, with renewed agency over your own life.</p>

      </button>
      
      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>I didn't come to Vedic astrology as an intellectual pursuit. I came because the same questions kept repeating in my own life, and conventional answers stopped working.</p>
        
        <p>Loss, prolonged uncertainty, and periods of internal conflict shaped important phases of my life. During those years, decisions felt heavier than situations warranted. Relationships carried familiar tensions despite changing circumstances. I kept wondering: <em>why does this keep happening?</em></p>
        
        <p>Astrology entered my life not as belief or escape, but as a way to understand why similar situations kept resurfacing, why timing mattered more than effort in certain phases, and why some problems resolved only when approached differently. What I found wasn't vague symbolism. It was a rigorous framework that explained patterns I had already lived through, including their timing.</p>
        
        <p>Modern life has removed many buffers that once helped people course-correct early. Families are smaller. Support systems are fragmented. Patterns that once resolved quietly now accumulate into burnout or breakdown. Vedic astrology offers early visibility into these patterns, so action can be taken before crisis becomes inevitable.</p>
        
        <p>I Read Space grew from this lived confrontation with repetition, uncertainty, and the search for clarity that holds up under pressure.</p>

        <h2>What Is Vedic Astrology</h2>

      </button>
      
      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>Vedic astrology is a predictive system, thousands of years old, used to understand repeating life patterns, decision timing, and periods of challenge or opportunity.</p>
        
        <p>Unlike Western astrology (which focuses on personality and psychology), Vedic astrology emphasizes <em>timing</em>: when specific themes activate, how long they last, and what actions align with each phase.</p>
        
        <p>Charts reveal why one person repeatedly attracts unstable partnerships, why another faces career stagnation despite competence, or why health issues surface under stress rather than randomly. A birth chart shows what's already set in motion and when particular themes become active.</p>
        
        <p>Some events unfold regardless of effort. Others respond strongly to timing and preparedness. Vedic astrology exists to clarify this distinction, so you're not left guessing why life feels harder than it should.</p>

      </button>
      
      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>My work focuses on identifying patterns that repeat unless addressed, periods when life pushes for change, and phases where restraint prevents damage.</p>
        
        <p>I use planetary periods, transits, and focused question-based techniques to understand what's likely to unfold, how intensely it may express, and what response reduces unnecessary loss. Charts point to specific periods, triggers, and outcomes, not just themes. This allows people to prepare rather than react.</p>
        
        <p>Some patterns soften through effort. Others must be navigated with preparation rather than resistance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Astrology doesn't replace doctors, therapists, or professional advice. It flags vulnerabilities before they harden, so corrective steps can be taken in time.</p>
        
        <p>I offer clarity that helps people make better decisions when the stakes are real, along with compassion for what they're carrying. No dramatic predictions. No false certainty.</p>

      <div class="about-section-content">
        <p>My approach is shaped by how I've lived and worked.</p>
        
        <p>Years in product management trained me to evaluate trade-offs, long-term consequences, and imperfect decisions made under pressure. Training in social sciences and business deepened my understanding of power dynamics, emotional conditioning, and behavioural patterns. Over a decade of Vipassana practice strengthened my ability to observe without reacting and to sit with complexity without forcing answers.</p>
        
        <p>I am at the beginning of my practice as an astrologer, but not at the beginning of my inquiry. Years of personal study, lived confrontation with these patterns, and a commitment to rigorous, ethical practice guide every session. I'm building this work one conversation at a time.</p>
        
        <p>This lens allows me to read charts without projection or exaggeration. Patterns are examined in relation to real life circumstances, not isolated symbols.</p>
        
        <p>I hold your questions with care. The work we do together is confidential, serious, and without judgment.</p>
